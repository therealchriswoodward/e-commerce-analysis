# E-Commerce Analysis
Kaggle Project

Analyzing categorical and numeric data from an e-commerce business.

* I created a database
* Queried the data I needed with SQL and stored it in Pandas data frames
* I automated the process of generating a report
    * When you download the report, the images do need to be resized and any advanced formatting you want to change needs to be adjusted.
* Used robust statistical methods alongside more common ones to show the difference between the two, and plotted the results side-by-side with seaborn
* Developed clear visualizations
* Created a simple dashboard in Power BI with my dataframes

## [My Notebook](https://github.com/therealchriswoodward/e-commerce-analysis/blob/main/Notebook.ipynb)

My notebook shows my entire process from beginning to end. I used SQL magic to execute SQL queries to gather the data I needed from the database I created.

## [My Dashboard](https://github.com/therealchriswoodward/e-commerce-analysis/tree/main/Dashboard%20Screenshots)

I created a simple and clear dashboard in Power BI to show the dataframes I created with my SQL queries

## [My Data Frames (csv files)](https://github.com/therealchriswoodward/e-commerce-analysis/tree/main/My%20Data%20Frames)

These are the csv files containing the data frames I created with my SQL queries throughout my process.

## [All Visuals](https://github.com/therealchriswoodward/e-commerce-analysis/tree/main/All%20Visuals)

All Visuals is where I have stored every graph I created in my notebook for reference.

## [Automated Report](https://github.com/therealchriswoodward/e-commerce-analysis/blob/main/REPORT.docx)

The automated report is a Word document that I generated with code throughout my notebook. When I reached my stopping point, I added a line of code to save the document which created it. * When you download it, the images will need to be resized as this doesn't happen during generation.
