# e-commerce-analysis
Kaggle Project

Analyzing categorical and numeric data from an e-commerce business.

* I created a database
* Queried the data I needed with SQL and stored it in Pandas data frames
* I automated the process of generating a report
* Used robust statistical methods alongside more common ones to show the difference between the two, and plotted the results side-by-side with seaborn
* Developed clear visualizations
* Created a simple dashboard in Power BI with my dataframes
